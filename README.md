Title: A Restfull WebService using Play Framework 2.5.
=================================================================================================

Description:
------------

 An android app which allows a user to register and log into my web service, which once logged in,
 listens for any Heart Beat warning messages from the server. If there are any such warnings, the 
 app sends an SMS text to the user's I.C.E to alert them of the problem and the user's location.
